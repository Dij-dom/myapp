MingAI is an intelligent personal improvement application designed to help users turn their ambitious goals into actionable daily plans. By leveraging the power of Google's Gemini AI, MingAI bridges the gap between intention and action, making self-improvement accessible, structured, and personalized.

## The Problem

We all have goals we want to achieve: "get fit," "read more," "learn a new skill." However, these broad ambitions are often overwhelming. The initial motivation fades when we don't have a clear, step-by-step plan. Procrastination sets in, and our goals remain distant dreams.

## The Solution: AI-Powered Task Refinement

MingAI tackles this problem head-on. Instead of just being a simple to-do list, MingAI acts as your personal strategist.

1.  **Input Your Goals:** Start by telling MingAI up to five high-level tasks you want to accomplish.
2.  **AI Refinement:** Using **Google Gemini**, the app breaks down each vague goal (e.g., "Go to the gym") into concrete, actionable micro-tasks (e.g., "Go to the gym for 45 minutes," "Go to the gym in the morning").
3.  **Review & Finalize:** You have full control. Review the AI's suggestions, approve or edit them, and build a daily plan that works for you.
4.  **Daily Review & Targeted Feedback:** At the end of the day, review your progress. Based on your completed and missed tasks, MingAI provides new, targeted AI suggestions to help you improve and stay on track.
